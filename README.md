# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
Britta asked for my help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs appropriate transformations, and loads data into existing tables. I refactored the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
